# Multi Sensor Kit
The product is a sensor kit package consisting of different electronic sensors.
The sensor kit is designed such that we can test the sensors and see the result in the same
kit which is shown in the display. The basic idea behind this kit is to study the working of
different electronic sensors at the same place in a much simplified manner than traditional
way of studying different sensors separately; thus reducing space and time. Connections
are also internally made, so the person carrying out the experiment need not to spend time
on working on connections. The person just needs to select the particular sensor and he/she
can observe the required output without the need of further conversions.
The kit need to be plugged in to a mains supply and after switching it ON' it is ready to
use. Then the required operation to be performed is selected on the screen by using the
rotary encoder. Every input to kit (other than input of the sensors) in this kit are given
through this encoder. One of the different sensors is also selected in this way. The kit has
a arduino nano board based on ATmega328P microcontroller. All sensors and input output
devices are controlled by this nano board and this arduino nano along with other sensors
and components are powered by regulated power from IC7805.
This sensor kit consists of the five sensors. The sensors are:

1. Water level sensor

2. Flame sensor

3. Heart rate sensor

4. Gyro sensor

5. Alcohol sensor

It also consists of a rotary encoder and one Nokia 5510 Display.

SOFTWARES:

1. Arduino IDE: for programming of microcontroller

2. OrCad CaptureCis and proteus: for designing Schematic

3. Layout Plus: for routing of PCB

4. Coral Draw: for designing the enclosure.
